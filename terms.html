				</div>

				<p>Your use of, and access to, www.lips.co.nz (website) is subject to the following Terms of Use, which you are deemed to accept by accessing this website: www.lips.co.nz</p>

				<p>This website has been developed to provide information about Liquor Information Pricing Services Limited (LIPS) and the services provided by LIPS, and to make advertising information and other services offered by LIPS available to its retail and consumer clients (clients). If you choose to join LIPS or subscribe for any service offered by LIPS, the provision of that service to you will be governed by these Terms of Use.</p>

				<p>Protection of Personal Data To the extent that we collect any personal information about you through this website, we will use that information for the purpose for which it was acquired in accordance with our privacy policy, which is available at [insert link].</p>

				<p><b>LIPS Membership</b></p>

				<p>By submitting your details to join LIPS or any other service offered by LIPS via this website you represent and warrant that:</p>

				<p>1. you are over 18 years of age and able to form a legally binding contract;</p>

				<p>2. either: (a) the credit card used to pay for products or services (Credit Card) is issued to you; </p>

				<p>(b) you are authorised to use the Credit Card to pay for products or services;</p>

				<p>3. the Credit Card is valid and has sufficient available credit to meet the charges shown on the website in respect of the products or services that you have selected (Charges); and</p>

				<p>4. the registration information you have supplied in the joining is accurate and the email address that you have provided is for a valid and active email account to which you have access.</p>

				<p><b>Charges</b></p>

				<p>You authorise LIPS to forward your orders to licensed retail clients or suppliers to charge the specified dollar amount of the Charges to the Credit Card provided on your order. Your order will only be despatched for delivery once LIPSâ€™ licensed retail clients or suppliers have received an approval and authorisation code from the card issuer in respect of the payment of the order.</p>

				<p>We do not register credit cards and no card information is retained on any LIPS server.</p>

				<p><b>LIPSale Deals</b></p>

				<p>LIPS will advertise on this website, on behalf of its licensed retail clients or suppliers, alcohol or non-alcohol products (Sale Goods) for sale to its members and the public for a limited period at a discounted price off the recommended retail price (RRP) as advised by that client to LIPS (Sale). The RRP is the highest standard RRP for those Sale Goods and includes GST and the advertised sale price for the Sale Goods also includes GST.</p>

				<p>You understand and agree that to purchase any alcohol Sale Goods you MUST be over 18 years of age. You acknowledge that it is illegal to purchase alcohol if you are under 18 years old and it is also illegal to falsely declare your age in order to buy alcohol.</p>

				<p>LIPS collates orders for Sale Goods on behalf of its licensed retail clients or suppliers through the website. It does not supply Sale Goods to you directly. If you wish to place an order for Sale Goods then you must complete the Order Form in full on the website and submit it to LIPS at orders@lips.co.nz (Order). Once you place an Order, you are obligated to complete the transaction in the manner specified by the licensed retail client or supplier, and you must make full and prompt payment for your Order. LIPS will dispatch Orders to its licensed retail clients or suppliers and you agree to your contact details and other information being provided by LIPS to its retail clients or suppliers. </p>

				<p><b>Delivery Information</b></p>

				<p>You will be contacted by LIPSâ€™ licensed retail clients or suppliers to confirm receipt of your Order. The retail clients or suppliers have the right to reject any Order in their sole discretion. Once the licensed retail client or supplier confirms that payment has been made by you and that it has been honoured, it will deliver your Order directly to the address specified on the Order Form. All deliveries are by courier and direct to your door. The courier will require a signature upon delivery from the legal purchaser. Identification may be required to confirm identity and age. If no one is home, the courier will leave a card requesting that you contact the Courier office to arrange a suitable delivery time. An alternative delivery address can be supplied for delivery i.e. your work.</p>

				<p>The retail client or supplier will usually deliver your Order within 3-5 working days following its receipt of payment from you. During some peak selling times (such as Christmas, Easter and public holidays as well as other times) it may take longer to deliver your Order to you.</p>

				<p>You will be able to place orders through LIPS while stocks of the Sale Goods last. You need to purchase the minimum quantity of Sale Goods specified on the website. All of LIPS members order Sale Goods on a first in, first served basis.</p>

				<p>LIPS reserves the right to refuse to take your Order if the number of allocated Sale Goods available by the retail clients or suppliers has been previously ordered.</p>

				<p>If your Order is not delivered to you within a reasonable time or if you have damaged or missing parts of your Order, then you can email LIPS at orders@lips.co.nz and LIPS will refer your complaint to its licensed retail clients or suppliers who will contact you directly.</p>

				<p>You acknowledge and agree that LIPS acts as an agent for its licensed retail clients and suppliers when collating Orders and has no liability to you whatsoever in respect of the Sale Goods. If an Order is accepted by the retail clients or suppliers, and you make payment to the retail clients or suppliers, which is accepted by them, then a contract is formed between you and the retail clients or suppliers directly. Orders and all other contact between you and the retail clients and suppliers </p>

				<p>are conducted entirely at your own risk. LIPS gives no undertakings, representations or warranties in relation to items sold or advertised on the website, including the quality, or price of the Sale Goods, or as to delivery times for an Order.</p>

				<p>You expressly understand and agree that in respect of the Sale Goods:</p>

				<p>(a) LIPS is not supplying the Sale Goods to you;</p>

				<p>(b) without limiting these Terms of Use in any way, LIPS disclaims all implied conditions or warranties;</p>

				<p>(c) no advice or information that is obtained by you from LIPS shall create any warranty that is not expressly stated in these Terms of Use; and</p>

				<p>(d) responsibility for the content of advertisements and the determination of the RRP and the price of the Sale Goods rests completely with the licensed retail clients and suppliers who are solely responsible for any representation made in any advertisement or otherwise.</p>
